    "## Named Queries - Using WITH Clause\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us understand how to use `WITH` clause to define a named query.\n",
    "\n",
    "* At times we might have to develop a large query in which same complex logic need to be used multiple times. The query can become cumbersome if you just define the same logic multiple times.\n",
    "* One of the way to mitigate that issue is by providing the name to the logic using WITH clause.\n",
    "* We can only use the names provided to named queries as part of the main query which follows the WITH clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "In case of frequently used complex and large query, we use named queries while defining the views. We will then use view for reporting purposes.\n",
